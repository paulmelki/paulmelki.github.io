We plan to take up to 16 Clemson students for a one-month stay at the University of Nicosia from June 1, 2018 to July 3, 2018. Every student must take two courses (6 total credit hours). One class, POSC 3610, will be an international conflict course that tailors our theories and findings about the causes of war to the 1974 conflict that led to the current division of Cyprus into two territorial entities. Students will also take a Middle East politics class, as taught by a University of Nicosia faculty member, as credit for POSC 4760 at Clemson. Students will have plenty of opportunity for travel on the island, including trips to Kerynia and Famagusta in the North as well as Paphos, Polis, Larnaca, and Ayia Napa.

## Eligibility

Minimum GPA: 2.5. Courses are open to students of all majors and classes.

## Coursework

Students will take POSC 3610 (as taught by the Clemson program leader) and a class on Middle East politics as credit for POSC 4760.

## Accommodation

Students will stay at apartments/flats conveniently located two blocks from the university and with multiple shopping and eating options nearby.
