## Okay, Why Else?

This program in Cyprus presents a unique opportunity for students interested in international conflict.

- Safest possible place to learn about Middle East politics
- Safest possible place to experience a (frozen) territorial conflict

You'll get to see scars from the worst things humans can do to each other, at absolutely zero risk to yourself.

# Why else?

## Cyprus is a Unique Country

- Island is effectively the only occupied country in the European Union.
- The British still own about 3% of the island.
- Unique confluence of Muslim/Orthodox Christian influence
