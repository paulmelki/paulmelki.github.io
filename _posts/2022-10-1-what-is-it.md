*Bordeaux, France*

What is that invisible bond \
That links people together unknowingly? \
Beyond my own self I know no one, \
Or at least that's what you've been told. \
But what is it that links people together, \
Unknowingly? \
For it is there, it exists, \
You can deny it, it exists, \
That which links people together. 

\* \* \*

"Beyond my own self I know no one." \
But without the other, who am I? \
So that without the other, \
Even I am unknown. \
"Beyond my own mortality, \
There exists no truth." \
Have you taken the time, \
To contemplate a sunset, \
To listen to the ocean, \
To hug a tree? \
Or perhaps... \
Simply to open a book, \
To savour some words, \
To be free?

In that which is simple, \
There begins the journey. 

\* \* \*

There it is, perhaps I can see it, \
That link which binds everyone. \
I can see it, as through a mirror, \
Darkly. \
It is fleeting, \
It escapes me, \
I try to follow it, \
I walk, south, then west, \
A wall: \
"Beyond my own self, \
I know no one."

\* \* \*

East, then north, \
Then north again, \
Always to the north, \
Many roads, I have been told, \
Lead south. \
But only few lead north. \
Who is ready to venture there? \
In that cold darkness, \
In that long long lonely night, \
Who is ready to venture there?

Who is ready to venture there, \
Towards that link which binds everyone? \
Beyond the long long lonely night, \
Towards that long summer, \
Where the sun never sets, \
And the river whispers the song \
Of the cold, old ice of winter?

For it is there, it exists, \
That which binds people together.

\* \* \*

What is it that binds, \
The cry of the newborn baby, \
To the last whispers of the dying grandpa? \
That which binds everyone, \
Even yourself and I, \
Eternally and momentarily, \
Everyone, everything, \
Every moment, \
Everywhere.

Beyond my own self, \
And my mere mortality, \
That which is north, \
And binds everyone together, \
Unknowingly, \
What is it?
