## **What is Scientism?**

*Scientism* is a term that has been coined relatively recently, that is, in the last two hundred years or so. It has been defined with varying degrees of generality and exactitude, but all definitions hover around the same reality. As defined by MIT physicist Ian Hutchinson, scientism is the belief that “Science, modelled on the natural sciences, is the only source of knowledge”. Canadian philosopher Tom Sorell states that “scientism is a matter of putting too high a value on natural science in comparison with other branches of learning and culture”. British philosopher Susan Haack at the University of Miami defines scientism through what she calls "the six signs of Scientism" [1]:

1. Using the words, 'science', 'scientific', 'scientifically', 'scientist', etc., honorifically, as generic terms of epistemic praise.
2. Adopting the manners, the trappings, the technical terminology, etc., of the sciences, irrespective of their real usefulness.
3. A preoccupation with demarcation, i.e. with drawing a sharp line between genuine science, the real thing, and `pseudo-scientific' imposters.
4. A corresponding preoccupation with identifying the `scientific method', presumed to explain how the sciences have been so successful. 
5. Looking to the sciences for answers to questions beyond their scope.
6. Denying or denigrating the legitimacy or the worth of other kinds of inquiry besides the scientific, or the value of human activities other inquiry, such as poetry or art.''

Put this way, it would seem that scientism is a concept that is particular only to academic circles, to be discussed by philosophers and scientists around their warm cups of coffee. But as it turns out, this is not the case. In fact, it seems that scientism is a belief that is extremely attractive and adhered to in the modern world, whether people are actually aware of it (very rarely) or not. For scientism is another form of extreme pseudo-scepticism, whereby the only true knowledge attainable is the one which can be proven scientifically. This extends beyond knowledge exclusively, to the extent that science is somehow expected to provide decisional, fundamental answers to existential, philosophical, ethical, aesthetical and theological enquiries. It is the expectation that science can tell us how to form and develop moral and ethical behaviour, among other things which definitely are outside the realm and domain of science. It is also a movement of thought that undermines other aspects of human endeavour and pursuits, such as arts, philosophy, law and theology, to name a few, considering them somehow "lesser" forms of knowledge. Such a movement of thought, is not only harmful to other facets of knowledge, but also to science itself.

## **Science, and Scientism**
According to the *Merriam-Webster* dictionary, science is defined as "knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation". After consulting multiple resources, it seems that everyone agrees more or less on this definition. It would surely be beneficial to study this definition with some meticulousness, as it would allow us to identify the boundaries of the realm of science, and thus show us more clearly where scientism goes wrong. The first part that deserves our attention is that science pertains to the natural world, which includes animals, plants and other things that exist in nature and are not made by humans. As such, the boundaries of science end with the natural world, which is a subset of the material world. The main purpose of science is to try to understand the phenomena that manifest themselves into the material world by describing them. How does it endeavour to achieve that? "Through experiments and observation", as the definition tells us. For as we all know, many manifestations in the real world are not truly what they seem, and close examination is required to disentangle the reality of things. This is done through scientific experimentation, which follows a well-established scientific method of inquiry. It begins with forming a research goal, setting up a hypothesis, gathering the required data, conducting experiments and analysing their results then formulating the conclusions to which the results are pointing. By all means, science is one of the most important endeavours that humans have established throughout history, and scientific methodology one of the truest and perhaps surest way of arriving to some (but only some) aspects of Knowledge. To echo the words of Von Hayek [2]: "It need scarcely be emphasised that nothing we shall have to say is aimed against the methods of science in their proper sphere or is intended to throw the slightest doubt on their value". However, what we often forget is that science and its method of inquiry are important and crucial in their own realm, in their own domain, and their extension to other spaces of Knowledge may not bring much value to those fields, and may perhaps be even harmful. This is precisely what scientism is, and where it leads us astray. As Von Hayek says: "[Scientism is] an attitude which is decidedly unscientific in the true sense of the word, since it involves a mechanical and uncritical application of habits of thoughts to fields different from those in which they have been formed".

## **Scientism in Modern Society**

Scientism is not a particularity of academic circles. Indeed, it is a widely accepted paradigm of thinking in modern society. The closest thing we could get to statistics about the number of "scientistic" people in the world is perhaps the numbers of copies sold of books written by disciples of scientism, "scientists" such as Lawrence Krauss, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Richard Dawkins. One may even allow oneself to classify these books as "airport science", as you will probably find them in every airport you visit in the world, readily available to entertain you on your upcoming flight. I could not find accurate statistics showing the number of copies sold, but I guess the simple observation of the wide spread of these books may be a valid indicator. 

I am surely not against the popularisation of scientific topics, nor the simplification of science so that a wider portion of the population may be familiar with what is going on in academic and technological circles. After all, not everyone is getting paid, has the time, or even the motivation to consult and follow long scientific articles full of bizarre symbols and formulations. A highly educated and cultured society is surely a safer and more nourishing environment to exist in; Athenian and Byzantine societies being great historical instances. This, of course, is based on the premise that these "popular science"  books are indeed providing an honest but simplified version of science. However, this is not always the case; for these science popularisers seem to be imbuing their books with statements that elevate Science beyond its natural limit, and diminish other domains of human inquiry. Statements such as: "My concern here is that the philosophers believe they are actually asking deep questions about nature. And to the scientist it’s, what are you doing? Why are you concerning yourself with the meaning of meaning"  (Neil DeGrasse Tyson) [3]; or "science disproves the existence of God" (Richard Dawkins); or even titles of books such as *Cosmic Queries: StarTalk’s Guide to Who We Are, How We Got Here, and Where We Are Going* have an extensive impact on a culturally-poor population devoid of a well-rooted education in philosophy, or even in true science -- and are mostly signs of the extreme naivety of their authors. 

It is completely unsure that science can actually tell us *how we got here*, much less perhaps about *who we are*. Surely, scientific inquiries in neuroscience and psychology may contribute to describing the mechanisms by which we think, perceive, feel and even behave, but can it be said that they are actually telling us who we are by these (perhaps purely) physical descriptions? Furthermore, can we say that an advancement in neuroscience enlightening us about the behaviour of a new region of the brain, for example, is telling us more about who we are than, say, reading *Jane Eyre* or contemplating Raphael's majestic painting *The School of Athens*, or praying at the temple? I do not think that any refined person can answer positively to the previous question. One may argue that indeed scientific advancements will show that the feelings of awe and wonder, pain and sadness, excitement and giddiness, that we feel while listening to Beethoven’s *Ninth Symphony* are simply results of neuro-chemical mechanisms triggered in the body. Surely, this is true. But this is only part of the story, and never the whole story. Again, this is precisely where the problem lies: when we start to believe that this is the full story.

The problem is exacerbated in modern society when we start to turn towards Science for answers that are clearly beyond its boundaries. One field that has been heavily bombarded by this plague is perhaps the study of ethics. For it seems to me that we are living in a society where science is expected to tell us what is Right and what is Wrong, or how we should behave morally and ethically in this world, when never before in the history of humanity was science granted such a pristine position of defining moral behaviour. As scientific and technological advancements rapidly increase and heavily become parts of our lives, science will surely contribute to the answering of deeply ethical and existential questions, but it will not be the arbitrator of them. For science is fundamentally descriptive and explicative, but not prescriptive. It can help us understand the problems we are facing, but it does not provide the correct framework for tackling these problems. This echoes the fifth sign proposed by Haack, on which she comments: "results from the sciences can give us information about the relation of means to ends, but cannot by themselves tell us what ends are desirable".
