*Toulouse, France*

There comes a point in each person's life, I guess, at which they realize that 
they are changing internally, on a deep level. A point at which they feel they 
have to take decisions of their own and carry responsibilities they didn't have
to carry previously. This inflection point occurs at different times for 
different people, that's for sure. And it may occur in stages, and not all at 
once, if we are lucky. I'm rather unsure how to describe this inflection point,
but I will try my best.

It is the point at which you feel like a warrior, who has been practicing since
childhood with wooden swords and shields, with "enemies" who never really
wanted to hurt you. Yes, you may have had some broken bones here and there; 
yes, you may have fallen down many times and arisen again; yes, you have 
always thought you knew what pain is... 

Then.. hop! The battle has come.

You are here, on the battlefield. There is this couple of seconds in which you 
see the legions of the enemy rushing at you and you think: "Oh Lord, this is 
nothing like what I've seen before!" And you know what your first impulse is 
going to be? You know what is the first idea your mind will throw at you? No
matter how hard you have trained, no matter how many times you thought you have
fought before, no matter how "Spartan" you think you are... the first impulse
you will get will always be: "RUN!" Run away! Run for your life! Escape! 
Go back home! Go back to a place of comfort and ease and irresponsibility! 

And it is all in this short couple of seconds before the crash with the enemy. 
Your whole being is telling you to escape... to hide, to ignore the upcoming
difficulty. And maybe at one moment your courage fails you, and you really 
start to think of how to escape the battlefield. You're losing your courage. 
It's leaving you. You start to question: Why am I even here? Why is it so hard?
Why do I have to do this? And you're slowly starting to fade away, to coward
away.

All this, just seconds away before the big crash with the enemy. And only at 
that moment when you are thinking of dropping your sword and running, just at 
that moment... a light dawns deeply inside of you, a fire, unquenchable rages
out from somewhere deep inside of you. And you hear a voice, gentle, maybe,
screaming, maybe, but confident and steadfast: "Don't you dare run away,
warrior! We are here to fight! Have confidence and stand your ground! Yes,
the incoming is hard! Yes it will be painful! Yes you will want to run away now
and maybe even later! But here I am and I tell you: You're a warrior and you are
here to fight! And he who stands his ground with strength and faith as a warrior
will never lose!" 

And so you stand and fight. 

And it is that point in time, that point in one's existence, when we say: "Yes, 
I am ready to fight." That moment, that moment is the inflection point. The 
moment at which you are no longer a child, but a warrior. A metamorphosis. 

Yes, the future is scary, and there will come times when even the toughest of 
warriors will feel fear, will feel like giving up. And each time a battle
is over, another one will arise. We will win some, we will lose others, 
miserably. We will make mistakes and learn, grow and improve. It will feel 
scary and cold and lonely and dark at moments. But we are warriors, and we will
reflect the light emanating from our fire of courage into the dark unknown,
and let the Light be the guide. 

And so the battle begins. 

May we never run away.

No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere  
I see Heaven's glories shine  
And Faith shines equal arming me from Fear."
