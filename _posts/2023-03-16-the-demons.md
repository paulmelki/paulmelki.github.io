I stand with a deep sense of awe before this masterpiece, whose depth is yet to be fully seen and understood by everyone, including myself. This feeling is not new to me: I have experienced it many times before, after finishing others of Dostoevsky's masterpieces. Calling it a "feeling" may even be too shallow. It may perhaps better be called a *certainty*, a deep sense of *certainty* that what Dostoevsky has written is of the order of the spiritual, touching on truths that are at the core of the cosmos. It is not a book to be read simply as a novel -- for reducing it simply to a succession of events is to destroy its whole *prophetic* character. 

Dostoevsky is not simply writing to entertain (much like the majority of current "literature"), nor is he writing to propagandise (much like a good part of current "literature"), but he is writing to put into words what appears to be a *revelation*. To play a role akin to that of the Prophets of the Old Testament, who were sent to warn people of the imminent destruction of their city -- if they were not to take heed and improve their ways. Much like the Prophets, however, Dostoevsky was ignored by the people, at their own peril. We who live in the 21st century know what happened in Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution and in the world with the two World Wars. We thus know very well the consequences of ignoring what Dostoevsky was writing about.

In reality, it is all in the title -- or rather, two titles -- of the book. What are those demons? Who are the possessed? The whole oeuvre manifests itself as an answer to these two questions.

The demons are not people themselves, but are rather ideas and ideologies, apes of the Truth, that appear to people and take possession of them: these are the possessed. I would dare say -- to the dismay of modern man -- that these demons are beyond ideas. They are indeed spirits: the spirit of evil, nihilism, destruction, faithlessness, and loss of hope. Spirits that possess man so deeply and mutate him into what he is not. They are spirits that promise an earthly utopia, but only after the destruction of everything. The danger lies not only in the fact that this utopia is fundamentally unreachable to humans, but also in the fact that the belief in it gives the believer a form of excuse to do anything -- even the worst atrocities -- to reach this utopia. Do you really think that the path to a better world is soaked with the blood of others?

Dostoevsky, with his usual penetrating vision describes with surgical precision the evolution and movements of these demons as they take possession of people, of a nation, sowing all kinds of evil in their hearts. For some they lead to ignorance, in others they plant fear. In some they inspire disloyalty, to family, friends, community, country. In others they encourage all kinds of evil conspiracy. In all cases, they sow death and destruction. The worst has been manifest in the world, and millions have seen, and are seeing the consequences.

The way out is given in the book, only if we are ready to see it.
