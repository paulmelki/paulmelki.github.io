*Bordeaux, France*

One of the hardest decisions to come to in one's life is the decision to walk towards "the good". To take it upon oneself to become a better person, to leave the internal and external shackles that are preventing one from advancing towards betterment. It is already hard for us humans to set a goal, much harder even still when this goal is sublime and transcendent, a higher goal. And the echo of this truth is clearly articulated in religions, psychology, history, arts and literature. The idea of the struggle towards a goal; everyone seems to agree on its difficulty. And why, we may wonder? Why is something that is supposed to give so much meaning and enrichment to one's life, is also the hardest thing to pursue? And being so, why do many people not do it? 

While the reasons can differ immensely from one person to another, springing from multiple sources in one's life, one reason seems to be universal, blocking us from setting a point and walking towards it. And I find that this reason can be articulated as such: the second I set a goal to myself, I also set a judge to myself. A judge, sitting there, internal to myself and judging my progress towards the goal. This *judge*, that we usually call "our conscience" is probably what we are mostly afraid of. Why? Because it is honest. Because it tells us very clearly when we are doing something wrong. It is also usually referred to as "the voice of God" inside each one of us; guiding us towards what is right, moving us away from what is wrong. But we are scared of being judged, of being told that we are wrong, of *failing* and *falling*. And so we may end up choosing to crucify and bury the judge, the ideal, the goal, and wander aimlessly around life; a way that brings only emptiness and sorrow.

On the other end of the spectrum exists another truth, which we often forget to talk about, though we often discourse expansively about its opposite that I just discussed. This other end of the spectrum is precisely the case where we *tyrannise* ourselves, putting a judge that is too harsh, impatient, hateful and unforgiving. Such a judge may lead us to emptiness and sorrow that could equal, surpass and even lead us to that emptiness and sorrow that arise from destroying the judge and ideal and wandering aimlessly. The problem with having a tyrant judge is that he may sometimes seem like a good judge, always setting the bar higher for us to reach out to it and advance. This illusion may be quite destructive as each time we fail to reach the impossibly high bar, the tyrant will drown us in a spiral of dark, destructive regrets which eventually lead us to giving up on our goal altogether. 


Make no mistake, I am not calling for excessive leniency and carelessness. For being too lenient and careless will surely lead us to self-destruction. But tyranny is not the answer either. And as conscience is the voice of God inside each one of us, it surely can not be tyrannical, for God is not a tyrant. Yes, we are called to struggle towards greater grounds, to be athletes practicing towards better achievements and more growth in all that is good. But the way is hard, and the struggle long and laborious; and so at times we will fail, at times we will fall, at times we will make mistakes, because we are humans. This is when the tyrant creeps in to try and darken the way ahead, to tell us that we have failed and there is no redemption anymore, that we are not good enough to reach the goal. No, this is not the answer. Patience, compassion, understanding and courage: this is how we stand up and move ahead again. 

For indeed we are all called to *ascetism*, a term usually linked to spiritual life, but which cannot be separated from all other aspects of life. Ascetism, comes from the Greek word "askesis", which refers to the discipline and exercise of athletes as they prepare and improve themselves. It is the middle way, the "royal path", between "economia", which refers to leniency, and "akrivia" which refers to extreme strictness and severity. And just like a person who is too lenient and careless will never become a good athlete, so one who is disproportionately too harsh on oneself will never become an athlete either, as they would probably self-destroy. It is this right balance, this ascetic practice, this healthy relationship with the internal voice of God that will allow us to advance properly on all (deeply-connected) levels of life, without leaving ourselves and others to wither in carelessness, or tyrannising ourselves and others into despair. 

Let us take courage, and keep the fight.

> "I jumped up. I said, "Fight! Fight!" I repeated. It is the effort and the struggle, it is the perpetual warfare, it is the shattering and piercing together. This is the daily battle, defeat or victory, the absorbing pursuit."
