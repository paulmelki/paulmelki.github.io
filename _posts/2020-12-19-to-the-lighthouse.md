Honestly, what a masterpiece! What a work of art!


I would say this book is like fine wine: it is not made simply to be 
consumed, but to be sipped, slowly, appreciatively. It is like a fine 
painting before which you stand in awe. It is like a beautifully performed 
symphony that leaves you a different person afterwards.

An absolute work of art on so many levels: Virginia Woolf's perfect 
out-of-this-world command of the English language, and her painting with 
words... And then the absolutely-new-to-me writing style known as *stream of consciousness*, 
which, in my opinion, is the writing style that most accurately reflects 
what actually happens in the human mind, leading you to discover and live 
the characters on a completely deeper level. I would say, in 
*To the Lighthouse*, one does not merely reads about the characters but 
indeed lives the characters, in all their complexities, their feelings 
and emotions and thoughts. I am afraid that no matter how hard I try, I 
will never be able to write a review that does this book justice. But 
then again, my review is not needed to give credit to such a masterpiece.

Glad to finish this hard year, with such a beautiful work of art. I think 
it is a book that I will visit again many times, if life permits.
