From this small book, one may derive plenty of wisdom and lessons, and definitely a lifetime of discussions. For it is a book that discusses *Liberty*. *Liberty*, an idea, a vision, a creature, that has lived and evolved, changed and mutated  in the course of history, in the extent of space and culture. *Liberty*, that mythical goddess that has been discussed and sung, painted and sculpted, and most strikingly maybe, died for by many. *Liberty*, a concept which encompasses thousands of other ideas beneath it, and thousands of thousands of interpretations. 

But if we are to reduce our discussion to the spectrum of this book, we may say that Woolf discusses, primarily, liberty of thought. Paradoxically, such a reduction of "liberty" to "liberty of thought" may be hardly a reduction at all: for it may be this liberty of thought and intellect that guides and pulses all others into being, both at the individual and collective levels. 

Starting with the first excerpts taken from Virginia Woolf's illustrious essay *A Room of One's Own*, one can clearly feel Woolf's passion for liberty and freedom: for it is in this essay that she writes a clear manifesto for women's freedom of thought and expression, in general, and particularly in literature. Certainly heated at some points, the essay however remains sober in general, departing from the bitter realities that had prevented women from expressing themselves throughout the centuries, Woolf presents with amazing depth of perception the manifestations of this intellectual oppression in the writings of certain female authoresses, even among the geniuses, such as Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and Jane Austen, whom I personally consider three of my favourite and most cherished authoresses. 

And here, in this essay, and in the small excerpts that follow it, taken from *The Waves*, one may start to see Woolf's sober take on liberty, which unfortunately may have been deformed in latter times, after her death. And this view of liberty may be summarised in two facets: true liberty comes with responsibility, comes with a *weight*; and true liberty is that which elevates the intellect and being and guides them towards higher things.

And here comes the tougher discussion to have. A distinction may needs to be made between *freedom* and *liberty*. A distinction so subtle to see, so shaded it has become in modern times, but may have been also so throughout history. This distinction may appear in this statement, followed by - a possibly life-changing - interrogation: *We all have complete freedom. But is every free choice liberating?* And so that crucial split of the hair may come here: not all free choices lead to liberty. This may be true not only on the intellectual level which Woolf is considering, but may be extended to all the dimensions of human life: material, psychological and spiritual. In many situations, choices, even those taken with complete freedom, may lead us into tyranny, a tyranny we did not want, nor have we asked for. A tyranny that destroys the liberty whom we have been looking for. And here, we may ask yet another tough question: is complete freedom, truly, liberty? 

Woolf gives rather clear answers to the above questions in these simple sentences taken from her essay *How Should One Read a Book?*, in which she says: "But to enjoy freedom, if the platitude is pardonable, we have of course to control ourselves. We must not squander our powers, helplessly and ignorantly [...];  we must train them, exactly and powerfully, here on the very spot". Even though these words have been written in the context of choosing the literary works on which one should focus, they can be transposed and expanded to much about everything in life. Woolf here is echoing a multitude of philosophers - and saints, even - to whom it was clear that true freedom, the freedom that truly leads to liberty, is the one that comes with a deep understanding of the inner self and a constant check and control of the self by the self. Again, the two facets presented previously appear again: liberty comes with responsibility; liberty is freedom which elevates. For freedom without order, may very quickly degrade to an unbearable chaos; while freedom with order and a sober watch on the self leads to virtue. However, this constant dynamic effort of keeping the free self in check may indeed be the epitome of difficulty for us, humans; and Humanity's history and our personal experiences may be very good and clear witnesses to that. In spite of all this difficulty, it may indeed be this struggle, this constant inner revival of the intellect and guidance of this free choice towards what is good, beautiful, pure and loving; this struggle, indeed may be what brings true liberty, and peace, and joy everlasting.  


> "To speak truth, reader, there is no excellent beauty, no accomplished grace, no reliable refinement, without  strength as excellent, as complete, as trustworthy. As well you might look for good fruits and blossom on a rootless tree, as for charms that will endure in a feeble and relaxed nature. For a little while, the blooming semblance of beauty may flourish round weakness; but it cannot bear a blast: it soon fades even in the serenest sunshine."  
-Charlotte Brontë, "Villette"
