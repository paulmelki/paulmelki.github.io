*Pride and Prejudice* is perhaps one of the most famous British classical novels in the modern world. Perhaps particularly due to the myriad of film and TV series adaptations of this *chef-d'oeuvre*, it has become a title which a surprising number of people are familiar with intimately, or minimum in a general way. Countless studies, critiques, reviews and interpretations of the work have been written since its publications more than two hundred years ago. I do not claim that I will present a great addition to the body of work already written, but I would like to present my reading of the "symbolic" meaning of the novel, which I believe Jane Austen may have intentionally aimed at embodying in her characters and narrative --- or which I may have seen during my reading of the oeuvre. 


At face value, *Pride and Prejudice* may appear as a simple tale of love and marriage, multiple marriages in fact. Indeed, for the purely scientific and utilitarian, it may provide a very good study of society in XVIIIth century England, and of the social norms surrounding courtship and marriage at that period of time. However, literature aims at going higher than the purely scientific and merely utilitarian --- or at least, good literature does --- and so should our reading of it be. I would like to warn you, dear reader, that if you wish that the events of the story be not spoiled to you, because you plan on reading the book or watching the movie, that you should stop reading here.

I would like to read this oeuvre while focusing on the two main characters: Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennet, and Mr. Darcy; occasionally contrasting them with the other couples in the story. In fact, let us begin from the end of the story: Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, indeed, end up getting married. How can we read this end of the story but in the light of the events that have led to it? For truly it is in this light that a crucial meaning of this end will reveal itself. As we know, at the beginning of the story, the two characters are at first unknown to each other, gradually get acquainted, but their feelings towards each other are at first those of mutual disinterest. This disinterest evolves down in Elizabeth to real "loathing" and anger towards Mr. Darcy, due to his proud and pretentious disposition, but mainly due to the intervention of Mr. Wickham, that *wicked* man, who poisons Lizzie's view of Mr. Darcy with his lies (it is hard for me not to believe that the name *Wickham* has not been an intentional motif by Austen). Here, a first symbolism appears: that of Mr. Wickham, an image of wickedness and untruth, disguised by very warm, pretty and friendly exterior and manners. 
So does the snake come and whisper lies. On the other hand, it is at this time that the love of Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth starts to germinate and grow: a true love, that is willing, though not yet developed enough, to defy even the pride of a proud man. Elizabeth, poisoned by the snake, refuses the pure and true love of the man who has still yet to humble himself. She refuses him with the most excessively hurtful words. An existential shift occurs at this point for Mr. Darcy, a man whose pride has made him close himself to the world for a long time. It is the shift that leads to the fall of the proud into the blessed humility which leads to honest heart into a redemptive adventure. Far from despairing, Mr. Darcy, having faith in Lizzie's reasonability and purity of heart, reaches out to her reason, and explains himself. Here, occurs another existential shift, this time to Elizabeth: she begins to understand, to know the truth. She has been set free through the truth which she was ignorant of thus far, because her mind and heart had the courage and humility to accept the truth. Let us see the pattern: Love destroyed pride; Reason destroyed prejudice. The shift in their existence was real, as real as the eternal dance of Love and Reason that maintains the world into existence.

The story does not end here, for had the two characters been only "passion" and "love", as what most modern romantic try to reduce relationships to, they would have degenerated to another case of Lydia and Mr. Wickham, which, as we find out at the end of the book, did not evolve very nicely. Had they been only "reason" and "logic", they would have become another case of Charlotte and Mr. Collins, whose outcome was perhaps not the worst, but which Austin still rightfully aimed at explicitly showing as far from the best. It is precisely through this evolution, this balance between Love and Reason, which have pushed the two main characters to grow, to evolve past their weaknesses, and to become the best of themselves to each other, that has led to the happy ending that has captured readers ever since the book first appeared. 


Through experience, we humans know this symbolic story, and perhaps that is why we so love this story. We all know, have gone through, and grown up because of Love: because we have been loved, we because we have loved. Whether happily or not, we have grown because of it. We have all gone through growth by reason: through knowledge of truth, through appeal to logic and reason. Against a destructive pride that devours the heart, and against the darkness of ignorance, lies and untruths that lead us to a prejudiced existence of loneliness, two antidotes are here, which, coupled, lead to the happy ending we all await: Love and Reason. One keeping balance to the other, one leading to constant growth through the help of the other. The human experience, since times unmemorable, has shown this, and so comes *Pride and Prejudice* to echo this truth; and to be a beautiful work of art to be appreciated through generations.
