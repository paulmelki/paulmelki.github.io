*Truly, we live with mysteries too marvelous to be understood.*

*How grass can be nourishing in the mouths of the lambs.*

*How rivers and stones are forever in allegiance with gravity,*  
*while we ourselves dream of rising.*

*How two hands touch* 
*and the bonds will never be broken.*

*How people come, from delight or the scars of damage,*  
*to the comfort of a poem.*

*Let me keep my distance, always,*  
*from those who think they have the answers.*

*Let me keep company always with those who say*  
*"Look!" and laugh in astonishment,*  
*and bow their heads.*

Allow me, dear reader, to turn your attention to the last stanza of this beautiful poem. For in this stanza, the whole structure of the Cosmos is summarised: *'Let me keep company always with those who say "Look!" and laugh in astonishment, and bow their heads.'* In particular, let me turn your attention to that ascension, that upward motion, that transformative sequence that the poet writes about. Namely, *"Look!"*, *laugh in astonishment*, and *bow their heads*. In this short sequence, the whole of Life is to be found. 

It all begins with attention: "Look!" Be attentive, see! Are we really attentive? Are we really allowing ourselves to look around us and distinguish the beauty of the world, the wonders of Nature, and perhaps most difficultly, the beauty in other people? Are we really looking with attention at the falling leaf in autumn, are we listening to the pouring rain and the whistling wind, are we really *seeing* the rays of the sun? Are we listening to others when they speak? "Look!", the first step is attention. 

The second is to laugh in astonishment. To be in awe, to marvel at the grandiosity of it all, at its coherence, at its beauty and ever evolving imperfect perfection. For the one who is attentive will begin to see more of Reality, and cannot help but laugh in astonishment. Laugh at how beautiful it all is, how it all makes sense, how it is all interlinked and communing. Laugh at one's own self, at one's own ignorance which prevents one from seeing all the refinements of eternal beauty. Laugh in excitement and anticipation at the coming, infinite mysteries which are yet to be discovered and explored. The second step is then, indeed, to laugh in astonishment.

The third is to bow one's head. For the one who is attentive, who laughs in astonishment and appreciates deeply, cannot but *worship*. To bow one's head is to become humble in the face of this created Cosmos of infinite detail, of meticulous elegance, of unending coherence, in constant growth. One cannot help but worship on the altar of eternity the Father of Wisdom Who has put it all in place. The third step, and ultimate one, is to bow one's head in humility. 

This ascension is not lonesome, however. For this evolution from attention to astonishment to worship cannot be attained but in communion with others: *"Let me keep company with those [...]"*. It is in this company, this communion of love among us, that the ascent can be made. To turn each other's attention to Beauty, to laugh together in astonishment, and together to bow down our heads and continue the eternal adventure of discovery and growth. 

*"Let me keep my distance, always, from those who think they have the answers."* Those who only bathe in the cold water of empirical facts, without reaching for higher delights, those who think that everything *can* be known, those who see life as simply linear. Let me keep company with those who are constantly willing to discover and grow, who see life as an elliptic ascent of infinite metamorphosis, those who worship with astonishment. That is, those who hunger for Life.
