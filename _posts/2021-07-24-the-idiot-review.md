It took me a week upon finishing this masterpiece of a book to put my thoughts in order about it. For it is no "normal" novel, and in many ways should probably *not* be as a mere novel. Not the least of the reasons is that it is written by Dostoyevsky, who *never* writes a character, a place, a situation, an event, without it having a deeper hidden meaning. So who is this main character, *the idiot*? 

In appearance, he is simply a Russian prince in his early twenties who has spent most of his childhood and teenage years in Switzerland being treated for epilepsy. Such a childhood and early years away from people have led him (maybe only in appearance) to be "socially awkward" (to use a term of our modern age). Upon returning to his native land, he gets to meet a plethora of new characters, which I omit to mention in details, but whom each is a complex structure, so deeply realistic, that the reader cannot fail to marvel at the depth of psychic and spiritual perception that Dostoyevsky had. Whether it is the good-hearted lady lost in the midst of *la haute société*; or the self-victimised narcissistic woman hungry for revenge though she doesn't understand what is driving her; or the nihilistic bitter young man who can't help but shake his fist in disgust and anger at God, the universe, and other people; or the people tormented by their wicked habits even though they fail to escape from them... two things are common to these characters. The first, I have already mentioned: they are realistic to the extremes. They are people we know, or who we will meet at some point in life; if we look and listen carefully enough. The second point, is that all these characters (whether they know it or not) are all so deeply influenced by the *idiot*'s purity of heart. 

For indeed, Prince Muichkin's purity of heart, which has led many to calling him an idiot, and which made him look like a naïve child (though in many scenes he appears to be the most sober and understanding person), has completely reversed and changed the other characters. Not only that, but indeed his honesty and compassion have revealed the true colours of each character. For proximity to fire melts down ice and burns the impurities that blur and smudge the truth. And it is precisely the prince's goodness and blazing charity and love which have allowed him to perceive what lies deeply in the hearts of others and led others to appear truly as who they are: whether they are truly good (though they may appear otherwise), or whether they are truly bitter and malevolent (though they may look civilised and comely to the extreme). To use a quote from the Bible, which Dostoyevsky himself uses in the book, "I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven, *because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children*" (Matthew 11:25). It may not be that we are called to be stupidly naïve, but to acquire purity of heart towards all (like children, or Prince Muichkin), and so contribute - maybe without even knowing it - to the revelation of truth to ourselves and our surroundings. 


This novel has around a thousand pages, and many more thousands can be and has been written to review it and discuss its interpretation and meaning. But I guess the best way is to "come and see". So I deeply recommend *The Idiot*. Dostoyevsky is, truly, a giant.

Some beautiful quotes from the book:

> “Do you know I don't know how one can walk by a tree and not be happy at the sight of it? How can one talk to a man and not be happy in loving him! Oh, it's only that I'm not able to express it...And what beautiful things there are at every step, that even the most hopeless man must feel to be beautiful! Look at a child! Look at God's sunrise! Look at the grass, how it grows! Look at the eyes that gaze at you and love you!...”

> “Once he went into the mountains on a clear, sunny day, and wandered about for a long time with a tormenting thought that refused to take shape. Before him was the shining sky, below him the lake, around him the horizon, bright and infinite, as if it went on forever. For a long time he looked and suffered. He remembered now how he had stretched out his arms to that bright, infinite blue and wept. What had tormented him was that he was a total stranger to it all. What was this banquet, what was this great everlasting feast, to which he had long been drawn, always, ever since childhood, and which he could never join? Every morning the same bright sun rises; every morning there is a rainbow over the waterfall; every evening the highest snowcapped mountain, there, far away, at the edge of the sky, burns with a crimson flame; every little fly that buzzes near him in a hot ray of sunlight participates in this whole chorus: knows its place, loves it, and is happy; every little blade of grass grows and is happy! And everything has its path, and everything knows its path, goes with a song and comes back with a song; only he knows nothing, understands nothing, neither people nor sounds, a stranger to everything and a castaway.”

> “God has such gladness every time he sees from heaven that a sinner is praying to Him with all his heart, as a mother has when she sees the first smile on her baby's face.”

> “Don’t let us forget that the causes of human actions are usually immeasurably more complex and varied than our subsequent explanations of them.”

> “There is something at the bottom of every new human thought, every thought of genius, or even every earnest thought that springs up in any brain, which can never be communicated to others, even if one were to write volumes about it and were explaining one's idea for thirty-five years; there's something left which cannot be induced to emerge from your brain, and remains with you forever; and with it you will die, without communicating to anyone perhaps the most important of your ideas.”
