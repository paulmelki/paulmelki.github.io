*Bordeaux, France*

*In this essay, I have taken the example of "freedom", for it seems to be the card that everyone likes to play to their own advantage. However, we may think of other foundations whose meanings have been lost along the way, sowing confusion: "justice", "courage", "love", to name a few.*

The greatest difficulty in the actual world we live in is perhaps to find that "middle ground", that "royal path", that cuts through all the noise, that noise of the masses: each screaming to their own god, and coercing others to worship at his altar. Ego, freedom, justice, liberation, oppression, shame... all unknown gods with misty labels. But, we like them, it seems, for they fill a void that we have become accustomed to ignore.

Yet, the problem, fundamentally, seems to be behind the noise that we see on TV, read about in the news, and constantly ingest and regurgitate on social media. What we see on the media: the chanted screams, the aggressive demonstrations, the oppressive manifestations, the provocative protest signs, etc. are all manifestations of a deeper problem. A meta-problem. An important part of the problem, I believe, is a lack of strong foundations. 

What are the foundations of what you believe in? Have you ever thought about that? You say you believe in "freedom", but have you thought seriously about what freedom is? Have you thought, at least, about the implications on yourself, on others, on the whole existence of what 'your' definition of "freedom" is? Have you, as a matter of fact, considered that freedom -- if were you to define it as your actions show -- would only translate as freedom for some and not for all? If you have thought about that and are okay with it, then how can you say that you believe in "freedom"? Shouldn't the foundational beliefs be universal to all? You may say no... then why do we consider them as such when we expose our opinions and debate with others, and apply them to ourselves? You may say yes... then why don't our actions and thoughts attest to this universality? 

Contradictions and self-deceit. Darkness on both sides of the spectrum. Who is ready to cut through this Babylon of incoherence that is the modern world? Shouldn't we always aim to look deeper beyond the loud discord, and reflect at least about the foundations of what we claim to defend? 

"I have come to bring a sword" (Matthew 10:34-36) says Jesus Christ. A phrase that has often been misinterpreted throughout history. For the sword that He talks about is not one that a group can use to bash another. It is not a sword pointing at someone. It is not a sword of death, as it has been wrongly interpreted. But a sword of Life and Light, and particularly -- in this confused world -- a sword of Truth. It does not cut through persons and groups, dividing the world. But it cuts through the confusion, the booming noise, through the attacks of both extremes, and points straight to the Truth, the eternal, the never-changing but always-contemporary, everywhere and constantly present. A Truth which is not loud, which does not hate; it does not strike to kill. It is a Truth that builds, takes patience, sacrifices and sows coherence. A Truth that unites on solid foundations. A Truth that, in the face of all this brouhaha, is silent and humble. As such, it is fundamentally a Truth that will be judged unacceptable by both sides, for it shines light on the incoherence of all.
