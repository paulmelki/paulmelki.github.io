*Bordeaux, France*

 There is something about T.S. Eliot's writing that fascinates me every time I read a piece he has written. It is hard for me to find the right words to describe it: there is something surreal, some kind of a gravity-free aura that emanates from his writing, you feel like you're floating as you taste the words he writes. This whole piece of theater is brimming with this aura: you read it as in a dream. The events, people, and places are very real: London, an apartment, a cocktail party, a failed marriage, middle-aged people. And yet... it all feels detached from this world. That apartment in London is all that exists in the universe; it is the universe. 

 It is hard to understand what Eliot wants to say. He is saying everything that anyone can ever say. He is saying nothing, for everyone has always known what is being said. Rather than trying to tell us something, it seems that he is trying to awaken an internal voice in us. A voice that has succumbed to the slow agonising sleep of death in a modern world in which spirituality and structure have perished, and only materialism and death prevail. The play was written in 1949, a time at which the world was still trying to rebuild itself after the great desolation. A time at which people have lost faith -- and they still do. At a time -- and we are still living in that time -- when everyone is internally crying: 
 > "There was a door and I could not open it. I could not touch the handle. Why could I not walk out of my prison?", 
 
 T.S. Eliot, with his characteristically Christian roots, comes to remind us of the eternal truth: 
 > "There is another way, if you have the courage."

And, 
> "if we all were judged according to the consequences of all our words and deeds, beyond the intention and beyond our limited understanding of ourselves and others, we should all be condemned."
