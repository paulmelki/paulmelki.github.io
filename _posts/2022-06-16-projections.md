We live in a world of projections. We have arrived to a point where what is true has become indistinguishable from what is pretended to be true, where mere absurdities through repetition and forceful projection have become regarded as truth.

Despite how much we are made to believe that there is no truth, or at least that there is no *one* truth, and that, after all, truth is simply relative, it remains true that humans cannot live and function without a notion of truth.

However, it seems we are always surrounded by mere projections, phantoms of what people pretend to be their truth. In this age of hyperconnectivity, in this age of short videos and empty meanings, it is hard to see where the truth is, or who the other really is. 

In this age of fast emotions and faster beliefs, it is hard to know what to believe. Phantoms moving in the shadows. Mirrors reflecting illusions. 

The harshest truth is that one rapidly loses oneself in this maze of banality. Who am I? Am I who I am, or who I show others on this constant stream of insignificant information? Am I who I am, or am I a string of bits, of ones and zeros, of zeros and ones, that no one can decrypt?

Am I who I am, or have I become a cheap client of an even cheaper product: illusion?

Others are screaming for freedom, so I will do too, but we're all slaves stuck in a sound isolating room. Screaming to the deaf and the deaf screaming back: Who am I and what is the truth?
