In hindsight, many things that verge on the unpleasant or the bad and that have actually happened tend to look as mistakes that could have been easily preventable. At least, we live in a society that makes it look like it is the case. From the daily deluge of (mostly useless) news that give the impression that even the most surprising political and economic events could have been predicted, to your older cousin that tells that “you should have known better that to do something so stupid”, to your friend who is feeling guilty about “how stupid she was to have done such a thing”, and perhaps to your own consciousness that is gnawing at you about some mistakes of the past. Let me tell you something: it is very easy to predict the past. 

For the past is only one realisation of an infinite possibility of realisations. That is, out of an infinity of possible manifestations of reality, only one observation actually occurs, and that is the one that *actually happened*, and that is the one we observe. There is actually even a mathematical name for such a thing: reality is a realisation of a *random path* or *random walk*, or more generally, a *stochastic process*. Now, surely the random process of history generation is constrained by the decisions that you and others take. As such, any decision that you take at any point in time will influence the probability of one of the infinite potential alternative histories manifesting itself in reality. For example, let’s take the example of this event: “Martin pets an arctic penguin in Antarctica”. Martin has lived, up to this point in time, all his life on the tropical French island of Martinique. As such, the probability of the event of him petting an arctic penguin in Antarctica is extremely slim, and one may say that it tends to zero. Now, let’s say that Martin, who is now 18 years old and graduating from high school, decides to pursue his studies in Zoology. The probability of the event in question actually slightly increases, because a new random path appears that may lead to this event happening. Graduating with a degree in Zoology, Martin decides to specialize in Arctic Zoology, as he is very interested in preserving the fauna in these harsh environments. Again, the probability of the event in question increases. You get the point now. 


So, as we look at history as a realisation of a stochastic process -- the one and only realisation that we actually observe -- it is easy for us all, even those who are not very well versed in probability or any form of mathematics, to become very good “predictors of the past”. For, seeing the outcome, even if through partial information, we can reconstruct (up to a certain error) the path that has led to this outcome. But looking back shows a completely different image that looking forward: simply, because the amount of information available to the observer is different. It is for this reason that people are quick to throw a “you should’ve known better”, or “how could you be so stupid!”, after the fact. It is easy to identify a mistake after it has been made. However, as Nassim Nicholas Taleb “screams until he gets hoarse” in his book *Fooled by Randomness*: "A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point". This seems to me to be an important lesson to live by in life: we cannot hold others harshly responsible for the mistakes of the past, just because in the present the event looks like a mistake. Perhaps they didn’t know better, and in most situations we can never know whether they had better information at hand. What makes a mistake, then, is not the impression, in hindsight, of a mistake, but rather the conscious wrong usage of available information at the time of decision-making, knowing that this available information will never be complete. It is easy and rather uncostly to be a good predictor of the past.

And know the place for the first time."
