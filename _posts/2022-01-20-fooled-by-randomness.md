*Al-Koura, Lebanon*

The first important point about this book is that it deals with one of the most complex and elusive realities of existence for humans: *randomness*. Not only is it hard to understand from a conceptual point of view – especially as it gets complexified through mathematical jargon – but it is extremely hard to take into account in everyday life. Nassim Nicholas Taleb (who lived 10 minutes away from my house) does a very good job in dissecting *randomness* from multiple angles: philosophical, mathematical, cognitive, psychological, economic, among others. He does all that in a language full of humor, anecdotes and personal experience. With an extensive experience in the financial markets – and a rather delicious distrust for MBAs, which I share with him (haha) – the author also discusses *randomness* in the context of the financial markets. He does a great job avoiding a prescriptive style of writing, which he himself abhors. Instead of advising the reader on what to do, the author tackles the issue from multiple angles, exposing his wide knowledge on the matter, letting the reader infer the point that he is making, which always contains an important lesson.

The topic of the book is one I deal with professionally on a regular basis, though from a slightly different angle. As an artificial intelligence researcher, practitioner, and developer, the randomness of the world is a key component to account for. In fact, it may be perhaps the central problem of intelligence and cognition: how do we understand the world, given how random it is? This problem is making hundreds of thousands of researchers and developers lose their sleep, for it is an extremely complex problem to account for, mostly perhaps because we do not even fully understand how humans deal with this (the book discusses this in-depth, heavily referencing the seminal work of Kahneman and Tversky as laid out in *Thinking, Fast and Slow*).  Perhaps an important concept to keep in mind is the short subtitle the author used at one point in the book: “Randomness Is Not Random”, which is a central point and existential reality that allows for artificial intelligence researchers along with statisticians and data scientists to exist. In fact, it is an existential reality that is deeply weaved in the structure of the cosmos and allows for existence itself to be (at the physical level). I’m starting to go far away in my thinking. 

This book has been to me a real fruit for thought, and a lesson-heavy read. I confess that I have learned much from reading this book, both at the scientific and philosophical levels, as it made me think deeply about heavy problems such as cognition and intelligence, the problem of induction, the various ways of arriving at the Truth, the probabilistic mind, and many others. It was also full of lessons at the personal level, perhaps the most important is the well-known platitude of “do not take yourself too seriously”.
