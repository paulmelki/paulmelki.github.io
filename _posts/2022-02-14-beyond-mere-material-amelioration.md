For some reason, many of us have fancied at some point in our lives -- and perhaps still do -- that material comfort and relative wealth are bound to make the person who is blessed with them a better person, even though a definition of ``better'' is never clearly stated when such statements are made in public discourse. We also extend this belief from the individual level to society as a whole, whereby material comfort for everyone is believed to be the precursor to world peace, universal friendship, understanding and cooperation, and in brief the originator of some kind of a worldly Utopia. This seed of thought is engrained in multiple -- often apparently adverse -- ideologies. For instance, both Capitalism and Communism agree on this fundamental vision: material prosperity. They only disagree on the pathway and management of this materialistic comfort, and the rest is details.

It is quite unclear to me how material comfort is bound to be translated into mental and spiritual comfort, as the story goes. After all, the material external world is perceived and translated through the means of the individual's internal world; it will necessarily be filtered, deformed then reformed, altered. If all these non-linearities are applied at the level of each individual's conception of the world, I cannot see why we have so much faith that positive material improvements will necessarily result in similarly guided effects at the individual and societal levels. That is, it is unclear how mere material improvement will necessarily result in concordant moral and ethical improvement. 

A careful reading of *Anna Karenina* by Leo Tolstoy provides a clear image of this distinction between material prosperity and moral robustness. This book offers an extensive and enlightening study of the Russian society in the 19th century, in its full spectrum, and shows the readers definitely that material, moral, and spiritual wealth are to be divided and not confused. One would think that the *bourgeoisie*, to whom all sorts of material comfort and peace are available, and who have been endowed with the finest of their time's education and culture, would be images of virtue and morality. One would think that people who are constantly exposed to the finest of arts, literature and culture, would absorb the finesse of their world and translate it into virtue and moral improvement. That is not the case. For we see that in a society in which everything is provided, and people are not made to care about anything of substance, they will turn to wickedness and debauchery in order to amuse themselves and others on a journey towards fulfilling an internal void due to this carelessness. The *bourgeoisie*, who were supposed to represent the guiding light to the rest of society directly or otherwise, have shown to be corrupted, so it does not come as a surprise that the rest of society will also be corrupted similarly, for ideas generally trickle down along the hierarchy. 

We should perhaps review our vision of mere materialism, of this constant search for material comfort *as a goal*. For in itself it can never bring the full development of the individual as person, nor of society as humanity. It may be pursued perhaps *as a means* towards higher goals, towards a transcendental understanding of the person and of society, beyond the mere material; for both the present and the past teach us clearly the dangers of a simple, futile, pursuit of the material, without the spiritual.
