 *Le Père Goriot* is a multi-faceted book. It is a tragic narrative, yes. But even more, and like all of *La comédie humaine*, it is a poignant critique of the Parisian *haute société*. A corrupt society that wishes to corrupt others. A society of external beauty hiding internal rot. A society of corpses wearing diamonds and expensive fabrics. In this book, Balzac blames this society of the highest of all crimes, that of the cold killing of an innocent person, making this story an archetypal narrative par excellence. For Père Goriot has sacrificed everything for his daughters, up until the last hours of his life, and died "like a dog" to use Balzac's own words. That is what he got in return: nothing. From his neighbours at the pension only teasing and disrespect; for he was an idiot to them, after all. From his daughters, neglect and ungratefulness, remembrance only when some money was needed.

Was Père Goriot completely innocent? Did he not have a hand in his own miserable death? Wasn't he the one who embraced his daughters since childhood with that pathological love that does not refuse any whim? Wasn't he the one who elevated his daughters to the level of Athena and Aphrodite, and worshipped at their altar? Weren't, perhaps, his sacrifices not completely self-emptying, but still carrying a hidden egoism? Yes, Goriot knew that on his deathbed. Perhaps he has known it all along, as he confesses on his deathbed.

But who was there, to listen to his confession? Eugène de Rastignac. The true hero of the story, perhaps the only figure who really respected Goriot, and the figure contrasting with Goriot. The young man at the gates of life and the world, contrasting with Goriot who leaves them by the back door. A figure, full of life, filled with the beaming fire of youth, righteousness, and that justice that only young people who haven't yet been corrupted by the world can have. This innocence, unfortunately, may not last for long. As the story advances, that innocence appears to be taken over by that evil spirit of egoistic calculations that the air of Paris seems to internally corrode people with.
