*Bordeaux, France -- written in Al-Koura, Lebanon*

Longing. Longing for that which is only for a moment within reach, that which is fleeting, but so valuable, and beyond value. Longing for that which is gone before arriving, for that which is beyond the moment. 

There are moments where only that which is forward matters; as if our life on this earth is to last forever. 

There are moments when what is gone is all that matters; visions of the past in moments of the present, shadows and illusions.

So what am I to make of that which is constantly fleeting, that point of focus where past and future are eternally momentarily colliding, exchanging, merging and reemerging. In that moment which is the only moment that I know and that I have ever known, in this present to which I long, and ever is longing, in this moment which is ever dying and resurrecting, where life and death meet, in that to which I am longing, there I will be, I was, I am, alive.
