*Bordeaux, France*

*This essay forms the second part of my study of a transcription of a lecture given by Prof. Richard Hamming in 1986, entitled "You and Your Research". I encourage you to give it a read as it is enriching and freely available in PDF format [here](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/stripe-press/TAODSAE_zine_press.pdf).*

*This essay may be slightly different to the first part, as it contains less discussion of the content of the lecture itself on courage, and more my thoughts on the topic, as I try to disentangle them in my head.*

Hamming states clearly: "*Confidence in yourself, then is an essential property. Or, if you want to call it 'courage'".* The clarification that Hamming adds in the second sentence, that of defining "self-confidence" as "courage", is an extremely crucial addition, whether it was intentional or not. We live in a world where "self-confidence" is a word much abundant, much utilized to the point of becoming almost *cheap* and lose its true meaning. Everywhere - on social media, in advertisement, in product design and even in educational institutions and familial circles - exists a wave pushing for the building and establishment of "self-confidence". Arising from good, and sometimes bad, intentions, this gratification of the Self, that is the Ego, which is very clear in the modern world, is, unfortunately, an ape and a bad mimic of true self-confidence. It is a rather thin layer of confidence, masking one's own insecurities from the world, and one's own self even.

Real self-confidence, however, is courage; as Hamming puts forth clearly. It is the courage that Aristotle refers when he states: "*Courage is the first virtue because it is the virtue which guarantees the others*". From here, the distinction between the two is clear: real courage breeds *virtues* and serves as a stable ground on which those virtues are to flourish. It is not a self-confidence that breeds narcissism, egoism, malice, polarization, hate, fear or silencing of others. It is a self-confidence on which honesty, integrity, humility and wisdom can stand and shine. 


Although surely not constrained to researchers, courage as a virtue, and its resulting countenance and disposition towards life and work, is of particular importance to those who have been entrusted, by the public, to "search for the Truth". This may seem like a very "idealistic" vision. For it seems that gone are the days when researchers and scientists were considered by society as the carriers of the "blazing torch of Knowledge" and the inquirers into the True structure of Existence. In the overly materialistic utilitarian world we live in, the researcher's work has been reduced to another "job" following the common banality of economic laws of supply and demand which are regulating the production of scientific material, and the scientific community slowly becoming controlled by competitive behavior of publish-to-stay-relevant or publish-to-keep-your-tenure, with deep conflicts of interest whereby the vision of Truth has become so blurry as to become virtually non-existent. It is for this reason that we need courage in research: 

First, we need courage to escape this swamp of utilitarian research and assume our true role as researchers who are here to search for the Truth, in whatever field(s) we may be, and to publish results with complete integrity and honesty with a clear aim of furthering deeper and more advanced research in the future, that benefits all of Humanity. 

Second, we need courage to ask the important questions (as discussed in Part I); to ask the questions that most people are afraid to ask, uncomfortable to discuss and in fear of finding answers to. It is courage to dive into dark alleys wherein each question takes us further into the depth of ignorance.  

Third, we need courage to take up the heavy load of answering these questions, and for facing this deep ignorance. It is the courage to set up all the working environment, frameworks and methodologies with an honest aim of answering these questions, and the courage to pursue the pathway that will lead to answers, that long voyage that may take many years and sometimes one's whole life.

Fourth, we need courage to go on about executing the work: experimenting, implementing, writing, rewriting, reiterating; and all the frustration and discouragement that creep up along the way.

Fifth, we need courage to stop and ask whether what I am doing is correct or not, scientific or not... honest or not. It is to ask whether the path I am following is indeed one that is valid and consistent.

Sixth, we need courage to accept the answer to the previous question when it is negative, and to go back and iterate again when it is needed. To see, perhaps, the work of many years be disqualified. 

Seventh, we need courage to persist through the long laborious years of conducting research, when we stop seeing the point of it all and fall into the pit of questioning the point of everything that we are doing. The courage to remember the responsibility we have, to remember that what we are doing is of importance to the whole world, and to Truth itself. 

Eighth, we need courage to accept criticism and to measure it carefully and honestly, and to engage with an open mind and heart in honest, constructive, and well-constructed discussions with peers and society with the aim of unshadowing the truth. 

Ninth, we need courage to take the responsibility: ethical, moral and humanitarian, of the work that we do. The courage to be responsible, honest and integral in our thoughts, words and actions.
