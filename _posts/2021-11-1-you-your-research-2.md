*Bordeaux, France*

*This essay forms the second part of my study of a transcription of a lecture given by Prof. Richard Hamming in 1986, entitled "You and Your Research". I encourage you to give it a read as it is enriching and freely available in PDF format [here](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/stripe-press/TAODSAE_zine_press.pdf).*

*This essay may be slightly different to the first part, as it contains less discussion of the content of the lecture itself on courage, and more my thoughts on the topic, as I try to disentangle them in my head.*
