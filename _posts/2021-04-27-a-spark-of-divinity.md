Deeply rooted in my beliefs is that we are *all* created on the image of God, we *all* hold a spark of divinity inside of us, and each person is eternal and unfathomably precious. Each and every person. It is a belief that goes beyond the social and moral obligations it imposes: it pertains to the nature of Humanity itself. 

For we are all called to reach up and inside, to find that spark of divinity and ignite it. Ignite it, so that it becomes an all-consuming fire that burns on and on, propelling us through this life into eternity. Ignite it, so that one ardent spirit can light up many others around it, and so spread the light to others beyond the reach in space and time of our limited earthly life, and by consequence into eternity itself. Ignite it, so that the abounding heat of this fire consumes our mistakes, our gaffes, our errors, and purifies us. For so it is: gold is made pure in the heat of the furnace, and we will have to go through fire and water, before being brought to a place of abundance (Ps. 66:12). Ignite it, lest we forget that it is a spark in each one of us, *each one*, and so we are all worthy of the outmost love and respect. 

And here, may be the hardest part: it is often easy to think that *I* am created on the image of God, and so *I* am holding a spark of the divine... but the harder part proves itself to be, seeing that others are also equally so. It is often hard to accept *the other*, to respect, to forgive, and most importantly, and sometimes most impossbily, to *love* the other. And why so? Because we may be forgetting that they too are also created on the same image, and are also called on the same path. They too are my brothers and sisters, they too are my equals and sometimes my betters. For the fire that may be burning inside each one of us, cannot continue so without others around it to keep it alight. And yes, sometimes the light may be dimming, darkening, inside one of us, and we lose the path in the dark, and it happens to all of us many times in life, but it is exactly at these moments that we need each other: to keep a little fire burning. To ignite that which has been overshadowed. To rekindle the spirits and thus continue the way. We often forget, that when the darkness looms, that is when we need to be alight, and together. We sometimes step back when the darkness looms, or even worse, contribute to its spread. But no, no. That is when we need to be alight: for others, *all* the others, and ourselves too.

Rage, rage, against the dying of the light."*
