What can one write about this truly "contemporary classic" oeuvre? If I would summarise all my thoughts in one sentence, it would be a small advice: *do not read it lightly.* Or: *be careful*.

For this book is like a vision, a ghost, a spectre: changing shapes and color and aura at every new episode. It is hard indeed to discuss this book without spoiling it. But then again, the author spoils the whole tale from its beginning telling the readers: "This is the central plot! This is when the whole world crumbles to the ground! This is when life is reduced to *nihil*! Now, let me tell how we got there..." And, oh now it's up to you, reader, to live with the looming shadow of the upcoming disaster, until you get there. 

But wait! After the cold cutting breeze of the upcoming misery has gone, we are transported back to the beginning: to a place of friendship, academic peace, and literary warmth. An environment of a certain "idyllic" perfection: of Ancient Greek and Latin and the familiar comfort of the classics: those oeuvres that each one of us feels at home with, as if living with people we have known since times immemorial. What a beautiful place to be! An old liberal arts college surrounded by mountains and nature, where students peacefully discuss philosophy, history, Latin and all the other things the outside world cares not one bit about... Isn't this the dream?... 

Wake up! No matter how perfect the external is, it is indeed the inside, the depth of the human psyche, that which colors the world. And as we come to this realization, maybe not by ourselves, but as the author leads us to it, the dark shadow comes back to taint the Platonic tableau in which we were living. From there, it is a downward slope into the darkest pits of the human nature.

Egotism. The darkest of the devils, the destroyer of souls. And I wonder if this isn't really the whole problem, the underlying dark angel at play in this whole tale. Looking at each of the characters and their actions, what has led to the doom,to that vicious cycle of destruction, which climaxed with self-destruction... What has led to all this misery? Isn't it egotism? What would a human do to protect his image? to protect his ego? Destruction... destruction until reaching the only possible conclusion of following egotism to its end: self-destruction. 

One may write many pages discussing all the possible interpretations of this classical *chef d'oeuvre*, but as time establishes this book as one of those that are "here to stay", I believe much more will be written about it. For some reason, this book is one I would **not** recommend to anyone, even if I dare put it in my list of "favourites". It is one of those books I would recommend only after getting to know a person well, seeing if it is possible for them to read it. Because, at least for me, just as beautifully tragic this tale is, so is dark its looming shadow, creeping back into one's memory with its cold breath.
