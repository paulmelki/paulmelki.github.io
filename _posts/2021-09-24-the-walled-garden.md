&nbsp;

### **The Walled Garden**

Swooshing waves, \
Cold sand dune, \
Cold salty water, \
Swoosh... swoosh.  

I hear voices, \
In the unending, \
Wave of waves: \
The voices of blooming life, \
Of unending renewal, \
Of never-ending decay. 

Swoosh... swoosh... \
Hear... hear... \
Is anybody here? 

\* \* \*

Beyond the horizon, \
I spot a shooting star, \
It tells me something, \
Hear, hear... \
And I follow, \
Above the darkening ocean, \
Above the endless expanse,

I follow the star, \
Twinkling and ablaze, \
Like a lover's tear.

\* \* \* 

Swoosh... swoosh... \
Hear... hear... \
Is anybody here?

\* \* \* 

A walled garden, \
Of exquisite beauty, \
The air was sweet, \
A gentle breeze, \
Caressing the leaves, \
Swoosh... swoosh... \
Hear, hear... \
Is anybody here? 

\* \* \* 

In the garden, \
Along one wall, \
I spot a waterfall, \
And I could hear it call! \
Hear, hear... \
You, strange visitor, \
Do come near. 

\* \* \* 

In the broken, \
Watery mirror, \
I could hear, \
Voices and echoes, \
Of falling tears, \
Rising screams, \
Dying beats, \
And burning leaves. 

In the broken, \
Watery mirror, \
I could see, \
Flashing by, \
Uncountable souls, \
Searching, \
Searching, \
And I screamed: \
Hear! Hear! \
I am here! 

Swoosh... swoosh...

And no answer, \
Came back clear.

\* \* \*

Swooshing waves, \
Cold sand dune: \
Beyond the ocean, \
I visited a walled garden, \
Where in the broken, \
Watery mirror, \
No one could hear...

Swoosh... \
Swoosh...

Hear... \
Hear...

Is anybody here?
