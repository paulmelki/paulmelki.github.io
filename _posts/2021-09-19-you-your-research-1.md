*Bordeaux, France*

*In this essay, I discuss and comment on one my recent readings: a transcription of a lecture given by Prof. Richard Hamming in 1986, entitled "You and Your Research". I encourage you to give it a read as it is enriching and freely available in PDF format [here](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/stripe-press/TAODSAE_zine_press.pdf).*

In this lecture, Professor Hamming discusses the right "style" for dealing with research and going about conducting research work that will have a lasting constructive impact on the world. Not only so, but he also proposes that this "style" is also a valid way of tackling other types of jobs, and more generally really, life itself. Anyone who has studied a fair amount of computer science should have come across [Richard Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) at least once, being one of the fathers of Coding Theory and the inventor of a multitude of algorithms, such as *Hamming's Code* for error detection, without which many current scientific and engineering exploits, including the Internet itself, would not have existed, or at least not in their current form. When someone of the grade and level of Richard Hamming is sharing his approach to dealing with research, we should indeed have an interest in considering  his words with full seriousness; given, of course, that we are harvesting the required humility, without which we cannot lead a "healthy" and flourishing scientific career (nor a life, in all of its aspects). In this essay, I try then to extract and present the main pillars of Hamming's proposed "style".

### **On the Importance of these Reflections**

Hamming begins by tackling the topic at its core: why do we even need to have an intelligent method for approaching research, and life more generally? Why should we even care about this topic? And is there a point to it anyway? To answer these fundamental questions, Hamming proposes two axioms; which provide a rather sober take on life: 

> 1. It is worth trying to accomplish the goals you set yourself.
> 2. It is worth setting yourself high goals.

Very good, indeed! Accepting these axioms as valid, and building a "style" based on them is a position that is rather hard to argue against. Unless we believe that everything is utterly pointless and everything should be torn down to *nihil*, then such a take on life is probably a healthy one. As a way of introducing these two ideas, Hamming evokes the fact that *"as far as I know each of you has but one life to lead"*, and *"that certainly near the end it is nice to look back at a life of accomplishments"*. This reminder of the boundedness and limit of earthly life serves as a salient reminder of why you may need to set yourself high goals and pursue them instead of *"[drifting] like the drunker sailor through life and accomplish much less than you could otherwise have done"*, to quote Hamming from another paragraph. Hamming also considers those who may object to such a vision of life, those who argue that it is all a "matter of luck". And there certainly is an aspect of "luck", but which is by no means a driving and decisive factor of rather one's career and life; but rather it is one's preparedness and sustained effort in the pursuit of higher goals. 

### **On Thinking Deeply and Actively**

Hamming begins his description of the right "style" by exposing the importance of thinking deeply. Deeply about work, and deeply about life in general. To not only study things at the surface, but to dive into the *essence* of things with an honest aim of trying to understand. *"Newton observed that if others would think as hard as he did, then they would be able to do the same things."* We tend to romanticise certain people: Newton, Einstein, Galileo or even Shakespeare, Michelangelo or Bach, as belonging to another "breed" of human beings; that breed we call "genius". These people certainly were geniuses, but do you think that Bach would have been able to write more than 1100 (at least!) absolutely gorgeous, immortal musical pieces, while laying down on his couch all day? Certainly not! Hasn't hes spent hours upon hours thinking, building and destroying in his mind? Sitting in his atelier, writing and scratching away, and throwing papers in frustration? For deep thought alone is not enough, but should be combined with deep activity and a quest for the Truth. 

### **On Working on Important Problems**
Prof. Hamming pursues his lecture by encouraging us, the listener (or reader), towards being sober, awake, and vigilant to what is happening around us in the world; whereby we should identify the most important problems in our field of study and work on them, or at least, try to think about them deeply. Here, Hamming invokes the episode in his life when he stopped sitting at the "Physics" table at lunch, because physicists started to care more about fame, recognition and promotion, rather than fundamental research. He instead switched to the chemists' table, without much success either. Upon asking, there, "[i]f what you are working on is not important and not likely to lead to important things, then why are you working on it?", he became unwelcome at that table anymore. Only after some months, did one of the chemists contact Hamming and thank him, because his question has made him think, and re-think deeply about his work (and only one!, reminding us of the story of Jesus and the Ten Lepers, in which Jesus healed them of their wicked disease but only one of them came back and thanked Him). And shouldn't we stop every once in a while and ask ourselves this question? We are more likely to dismiss this question and the part of us that dares to ask it, just like the chemists did with Hamming, because we're afraid of the answer. We're afraid to realise that "maybe" what we're working on is not the most important problem we can be tackling, and a change of track is needed. However, there is certainly a realistic limit to such scepticism against one's efforts: 

### **On Attacking Problems to Which There May Exist Solutions**
Now, Hamming (or our internal judge) is not trying to destroy the faith and confidence we have in the work we are tackling. Because, there will surely always exist some problems in our field of research and study which are more crucial, more fundamental, more "important" than the ones we are dealing with. However, *"a problem is important partly because there is a possible attack on it and not just because of its inherent importance"*. A balanced judgment between a problem's importance and the possibility of approaching it is likely to guide us on the right path of attempting the problems that are crucial but also manageable, which may in turn open doors to progress on other, possibly more important, problems which have been previously regarded as unattainable.
