Hello, fellow wanderer of the world and welcome to my blog! 

Let me start by introducing myself, and hopefully you will too! 

I'm Paul, a Lebanese researcher in Machine Learning and Machine Perception residing in France. I'm currently a PhD candidate conducting my industrial research jointly with
[Team MOTIVE at the IMS Laboratory](https://www.ims-bordeaux.fr/en/recherche/research/116-signal-and-image-processing/motive/184-MOTIVE)
at [Université de Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) and [EXXACT Robotics](https://exxact-robotics.com/en/), a fast-growing dynamic agri-tech startup based in Champagne.

I arrived to France to pursue my Master's degree in Statistics & Econometrics at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/) (Université Toulouse 1 Capitole & 
Université Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier) where I concentrated my studies on machine & deep learning, and statistical spatial analysis, and have recently graduated *Cum Laude* (With Distinction).

Previous to my arrival in France, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at the 
[University of Balamand](http://www.balamand.edu.lb/home/Pages/default.aspx) in my home country, Lebanon. I also pursued 
a Minor in Economics along with my CS studies (now you got your answer as how I got into Toulouse School of Economics),
and graduated *Summa Cum Laude* with highest distinction among the CS graduates.

On a less professional side, I'm an avid reader, mainly of classical literature and philosophy (but also of everything else too...) and you will
find much of my book reviews here and on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/paulmelki) account. I enjoy honest, deep, meaningful and well-constructed discussions that aim at finding the truth ("dialectics") and love to learn from others and sharpen my thinking, so you are free to discuss anything with me! I'm also a big fan of classical arts:
primarly classical music, but also of painting and architecture ; and you may find some ramblings I write on these topics on this blog. 
I love coding (obviously), and photography too, and most importantly, being surrounded by mountains and
trees and big skies. But well, enough talking... You will get to know me more, as you go through this website.

Life is beautiful, my friend! Let's keep pushing!
