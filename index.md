Hello, fellow wanderer of the world and welcome to my blog! 

Let me start by introducing myself, and hopefully you will too! 

I'm a Lebanese researcher in Machine Intelligence and Perception residing in France. I'm currently a PhD candidate conducting my research jointly between
[the IMS Laboratory (CNRS, Bordeaux INP)](https://www.ims-bordeaux.fr/en/72-en/extranet-en/125-accueil)
at [Université de Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) and [EXXACT Robotics](https://exxact-robotics.com/en/), a fast-growing dynamic agri-tech startup based in Champagne. My research is focused on robust deep learning, uncertainty quantification and machine perception.

I arrived to France to pursue my Master's degree in Statistics & Econometrics at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/) (Université Toulouse 1 Capitole & 
Université Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier) where I concentrated my studies on machine & deep learning, and statistical spatial analysis, and have recently graduated *Cum Laude* (With Distinction).

Previous to my arrival in France, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at the 
[University of Balamand](http://www.balamand.edu.lb/home/Pages/default.aspx) in my home country, Lebanon. I also pursued 
a Minor in Economics along with my CS studies (now you got your answer as how I got into Toulouse School of Economics),
and graduated *Summa Cum Laude* with highest distinction among the CS graduates.

On a less professional side, I’m an avid reader, mainly of classical literature and philosophy (but also of everything else too…) and you will
find much of my book reviews here and on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/paulmelki) account. I enjoy honest, deep, and meaningful discussions and love to learn from others and sharpen my thinking, so you are free to discuss anything with me! I’m also a big fan of classical arts:
primarily classical music, but also of painting and architecture ; and you may find some ramblings I write on these topics on this blog. 
I enjoy programming and problem-solving, and most importantly, being surrounded by mountains, trees and big skies. 

Life is beautiful, my friend! Let's keep pushing!
