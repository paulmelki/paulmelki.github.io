Hello, fellow wanderer of the world!

I'm just a guy who likes to find solutions to complicated problems, by making everything unbearably more complicated ;
until a simple solution is all that is left to do. Not sure how good this strategy is.

I'm currently a Master 2 student in Statistics & Econometrics at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/) 
where I focus my studies on machine & deep learning, and spatial analysis. I'm also an incoming research intern with 
[Team MOTIVE at the IMS Laboratory](https://www.ims-bordeaux.fr/en/recherche/research/116-signal-and-image-processing/motive/184-MOTIVE)
at [UniversitÃ© de Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/). My research will be centered around building robust ensemble methods for convolutional
neural networks used in the detection of plant diseases. Quite interesting! No? Well, maybe not for everyone...

Previous to my arrival in France, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at the 
[University of Balamand](http://www.balamand.edu.lb/home/Pages/default.aspx) in my home country, Lebanon. I also pursued 
a Minor in Economics along with my CS studies (now you got your answer as how I got into Toulouse School of Economics),
and graduated *Summa Cum Laude* with highest distinction among the CS graduates.

On a less professional side, I'm an avid reader, mainly of classical literature (but of almost everything too...) and you will
find much of my book reviews here and on my [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/paulmelki) too. I'm also a big fan of classical arts:
primarly classical music, but also painting and architecture too ; and you may find some ramblings I write on these topics on this blog
too (don't take them too seriously...). I love coding (obviously), and photography too, and (most importantly), being surrounded by mountains and
trees and big skies. But well, enough talking... You will get to know me more, the more you go through this website.

Life is beautiful, my friend! Let's keep pushing!
