Hello! I'm currently a second year PhD student at the Signal & Image Processing group of the <a href="https://www.ims-bordeaux.fr/" target="_blank">IMS Lab</a> at the University of Bordeaux (in the gorgeous Southwest of France). 

As my I'm a <a href="https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/les-cifre-46510" target="_blank">CIFRE fellow</a>, I'm also working in industrial context as a R&D engineer in the AI/Vision team at <a href="https://exxact-robotics.com/en" target="_blank">EXXACT Robotics</a>, a fast growing agri-tech enterprise. 

My research is focused on uncertainty quantification, statistical machine learning and computer vision, with particular interests in applications for agriculture, the environmental and earth sciences.

Previously, I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics & Econometrics at the prestigious <a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/" target="_blank">Toulouse School of Economics</a>, and my Bachelor's degree with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Economics at the <a href="https://www.balamand.edu.lb/home/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">University of Balamand</a> in my native country of Lebanon.

I'm also interested in classical literature and arts, trail running and hiking, philosophy and theology.
